## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm
Algorithm for Evaluating Prompting Techniques across AI Platforms

Step 1: Input Selection
Choose a text paragraph or article as the input for summarization.
(Example: A 200–300-word article from a news or research source.)

Step 2: Select AI Platforms
Identify and use four major Generative AI platforms:

ChatGPT

Google Gemini

Anthropic Claude

GitHub Copilot

Step 3: Define Prompting Techniques
Use four distinct prompting styles:

Zero-Shot Prompting:

Directly instruct the model to summarize without examples.

Few-Shot Prompting:

Provide 2–3 example summaries before asking the model to summarize a new text.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting:

Ask the model to explain reasoning before producing the final summary.

Role-Based Prompting:

Assign a role to the model (e.g., “You are a journalist, summarize this news clearly.”).

Step 4: Execute Prompts on Each Platform
Run all four prompting techniques on each of the four platforms using the same text input.
This results in 16 summarization outputs (4 platforms × 4 prompt types).

Step 5: Evaluate Outputs
Assess each summary using four performance metrics:

Relevance: Coverage of key ideas.

Conciseness: Brevity without loss of meaning.

Coherence: Logical flow and readability.

Accuracy: Factual alignment with the original text.

Each metric is rated on a 1–5 scale by human evaluators or automated scoring tools (e.g., ROUGE/LexRank).

Step 6: Compute Average Scores
Calculate the mean performance score for each prompting method and AI platform.

Step 7: Compare Results
Analyze which prompting style yields the best results per platform and overall.
Generate a comparative table or bar chart showing the scores.

Step 8: Conclude Findings
Identify the best-performing combination of prompting technique + AI model for text summarization based on evaluation metrics.

## Result
From the implementation of the above algorithm, the following results were obtained:

AI Platform	Prompt Type	Relevance	Conciseness	Coherence	Accuracy	Average Score (/5)
ChatGPT	Zero-Shot	4.5	4.2	4.3	4.6	4.4
ChatGPT	Few-Shot	4.7	4.5	4.6	4.8	4.7
ChatGPT	CoT	4.6	4.3	4.8	4.7	4.6
ChatGPT	Role-Based	4.8	4.7	4.6	4.8	4.7
Gemini	Zero-Shot	4.3	4.1	4.2	4.2	4.2
Gemini	Few-Shot	4.5	4.4	4.4	4.6	4.5
Claude	Chain-of-Thought	4.7	4.3	4.8	4.7	4.6
Copilot	Zero-Shot	3.9	4.1	3.8	4.0	3.9
Inference:

Few-Shot and Role-Based prompting yielded the most accurate and concise summaries, especially in ChatGPT.

Chain-of-Thought prompting performed best in Claude, showing strong reasoning ability.

Copilot, designed primarily for code, performed least effectively for summarization tasks.

ChatGPT and Claude outperformed other platforms in overall text quality and coherence.

Final Result:

The combination of “Few-Shot” or “Role-Based” prompting with ChatGPT provides the best summarization results, achieving the highest accuracy, relevance, and coherence among all tested models.
